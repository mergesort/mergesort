# I am an A+ developer. You can tell because that's what my README says and you cannot lie on the internet.

### And these are some of my libraries people seem to enjoy using.

#### [Boutique](https://github.com/mergesort/Boutique)
Boutique is a simple but powerful persistence library, and more. With its dual-layered memory + disk caching architecture Boutique provides a way to build apps that update in real time with full offline storage in only two lines of code using an incredibly simple API. It's truly magical, you have to see it for yourself to believe it.

#### [Bodega](https://github.com/mergesort/Bodega)
Bodega is an actor-based disk cache, and what powers Boutique’s automatic offline support. If you need a way to store data or Codable structs to disk Bodega gives you the ability with a very simple API. No changes necessary to your models or your code.

#### [Model View Controller Store](https://github.com/mergesort/MVCS)
A sample projet demonsrating the Model View Controller Store architecture I developed, powered under the hood by [Boutique](https://github.com/mergesort/Boutique) and [Bodega](https://github.com/mergesort/Bodega). If you'd like to familiarize yourself with Model View Controller Store you play with the sample app or you can read about the philosophy, along with a very technical walkthrough in this [post](https://build.ms/2022/06/22/model-view-controller-store/).

#### [TableFlip](https://github.com/mergesort/TableFlip)
`UITableView` and `UITableViewCell` animations are hard — really hard. But what if they didn't have to be? Instead of calling brittle methods like `reloadRows()` or `batchUpdates()` and hoping it works, the entire API for TableFlip has one function. Call `reloadData()` like you always do to get a guaranteed `UITableView` state, then call TableFlip's `animate()` with an `Animation`, and your animation is guaranteed to succeed.

#### [FeedbackEffect](https://github.com/mergesort/FeedbackEffect)
A micro-library for playing sound effects and providing haptic feedback, bundled into one line of code. Give your users that special touch by integrating sound and feel into your apps, easier than ever.

#### [Slope](https://github.com/mergesort/Slope)
Flat is out and gradients are in again! Slope makes it incredibly easy to build uniform or percentage based gradients, vertically, horizontally, diagonally, or even radially. You'll be making gradients in no time with the straightforward type-safe API is very straightforward, a real help for UIKit apps where gradients are still hard to make.

#### [GenericCells](https://github.com/mergesort/GenericCells)
Never make another `UITableViewCell` or `UICollectionViewCell` subclass again. Leveraging the power of generics GenericCells lets you build a UIView, and plug it directly into a cell, no extra classes needed.

#### [TypedNotifications](https://github.com/mergesort/TypedNotifications)
A simple drop in package to replace `NotificationCenter`'s untyped API with a typed version. The API mimics `NotificationCenter`'s API so much that you'll barely have to make any changes, but will get the benefit of type safety across your apps.

#### [Anchorman](https://github.com/mergesort/Anchorman)
Anchorman is a slick library that makes interacting with autolayout declarative and easy. There are many out there like it, but people seem to really enjoy using Anchorman for it's straightforward and intuitive syntax.
